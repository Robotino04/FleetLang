# Fleet

## FleetC
The reference implementation of Fleet.

Features:
- Compile all valid Fleet programs to an object file using LLVM as a backend
- Give meaningful errors for invalid Fleet programs

## FleetLS
A language server for improving the experience of writing Fleet code. 

Features:
- Syntax highlighting with `textDocument/semanticTokens`
- Partial syntax highlighting for invalid Fleet programs
- Error messages for invalid Fleet programs
- Formatting for parsable Fleet programs with `textDocument/formatting`
    - Automatically removes unnecessary parentheses in expressions: `((1 * 2) + 3)` â†’ `1 * 2 + 3`
- signature help
- hover information


## TODOs

### Priority
- add way to get length of array
- track definitions and references of variables
- tied to ^this^: warnings for unused functions/variables
- fix nested structs in glsl (mostly copy-paste from C)
- use byval attributes for arrays and structs
- import of some sort

#### Meta
- make sure web demo compiles and works
- Make sure README is up-to-date and actually good.

### Easy
- if expressions
- consistent error language style
- test array-to-array assignments in GLSL (maybe C as well)
- test bigger-than-float float literals with C and GLSL backend
- disallow returning arrays
- add different errors for missing Pass dependencies and for failed check_empty calls
- move runtime_type_to_byte_size somewhere common
- allow on-statements without iterators again
- add lint to make variables and functions snake_case and types CamelCase
- allow struct initializers to have any order

### Medium
- real mutability/constant system
- allow variable redefinition
- add quick fix system for e.g. non-block as if body
- maybe make non-block-statement fixes a code action instead of formatting. Replace `assert_compile_error_no_formatting` after
- strings
- remove lvalues maybe?
- special-case small 2D and 3D GPU dispatches that fit in the size limits
- parse statements even without semicolons (for FleetLS)

### Hard
- tuple types
- struct alignment and padding
- sum types
- comptime evaluation
- comptime type eval for generics (similar to zig/hblang)
- heap allocations
- after consteval, make math intrinsics a single compiler function


## Building
### LLVM
> [!TIP]
> If you have the [Nix package manager](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Nix_(package_manager)) installed, you can use the included flake to build FleetC and FleetLS in a single command:
> ```sh
> nix build .
> ```
> This will perform all steps listed below and write the binaries into `./result/bin/{fleetc,fleetls}`.

FleetC uses LLVM as a backend, and it is therefore required to have a static build of libllvm 18. If this isn't found, Cargo should detect it and give instructions on how to acquire libllvm.
Some other libraries are also linked by `inkwell` (the LLVM crate) and may need to be installed as well. Even if you aren't using the Nix flake, it can still serve as a reference for which libraries are required.

### Compiling the Runtime
Compiling the Fleet runtime is required for building the Fleet tooling. Assuming you have the Vulkan SDK and shaderc installed, this can be done using

```sh
cd fl_runtime/ && make -j
```

Note that, because Fleet uses LLVM as its backend, this Makefile is hardcoded to use Clang. Using other compilers like GCC or MSVC **will not work** as we rely on generating LLVM bitcode to be consumed by FleetC. 


### FleetC and FleetLS
After setting up libllvm and the other libraries, the project can be built using a simple 

```sh
cargo build
```

This should compile the project to `target/debug/{fleetc,fleetls}`.

### Tests
Tests can only be run on Linux for now as they rely on loading `libvulkan` and `libstdc++` at runtime.
If you aren't using nix, you need to ensure those libraries are installed and can be found by dlopen.


## Setup (FleetLS)
For Neovim users, there is a `load.vim` file that sets up the Fleet filetype and configures nvim-lspconfig to automatically launch FleetLS. It also has commented-out options for connecting to FleetLS over TCP which can be useful for easily reading debug output. 

For VSCode users, there is no Fleet-specific extension (yet). However, there is [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=zsol.vscode-glspc), which allows a connection to any language server including FleetLS. The following settings should work to enable FleetLS for `plaintext` files:
```jsonc
{
  "glspc.server.command": "<Path-to-FleetLang-repository>/target/debug/fleetls",
  "glspc.server.commandArguments": ["stdio"], // FleetLS can also serve over TCP. This makes it use stdout
  "glspc.server.languageId": ["plaintext"], // can also be changed to any other filetype you want to hijack for Fleet files.
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Using FleetLS through VSCode isn't tested well and may not work as intended. There may be an official extension in the future.
